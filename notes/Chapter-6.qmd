Spatial visualizations can be: 

1. Choropleth maps 

2. Point maps 

3. Contour maps 

They can be dynamic or static. 

2 important pieces of information we need: 

1. A dataset that includes either location coordinates for your points of interest (point map) or variable outcomes for your regions of interest (choropleth maps)

2. A background map 

You would use a JavaScript package that can be imported using leaflet in R.
