Types of reshaped data: 

- Aggregate data: for example, using group_by() with summarize() gains aggregate information about our observations but loses data on individual observations.

- Raw data, reshaped: we often want to retain all information on individual observations, but need to reshape it in order to perform the task at hand.

To change the format: 

pivot_wider: It will increase the number of columns based on the categorical variable chosen. Example: 

pivor_wider(table, names_from=cat_var, values_from=quant/cat var)

pivot longer: It will increase the number of rows based on the columns chosen. Example: 

pivot_longer(table, cols=1:4, names_to=var, values_to=var)
