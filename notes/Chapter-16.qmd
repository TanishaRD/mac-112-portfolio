EDA essentials

1. Start small: We often start with lots of data – some of it useful, some of it not. 

- Focus on just a small set of variables of interest.
- Break down your research question into smaller pieces.
- Obtain the most simple numerical & visual summaries that are relevant to your research questions.

2. Ask questions: We typically start a data analysis with at least some general research questions in mind by obtaining numerical and graphical summaries that provide insight into these questions.

- what questions do these summaries answer?
- what questions don’t these summaries answer?
- what’s surprising or interesting here?
- what follow-up questions do these summaries provoke?

3. Repeat: Repeat this iterative questioning and analysis process as necessary, letting our reflections on the previous questions inspire our next steps.
