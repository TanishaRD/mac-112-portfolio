Bivariate visualizations look at relationships *between* variables.
You look at the effect of the predictor (x) variables on the response (y) variable. 
You can use these visualizations to find: 

- Trends 
- Strength of correlation 
- Outliers 

Basic notes: 

- Every quantitative variable needs a new axis 
- Every categorical variable needs a new way to group (color, facet, shapes, etc.)
- If you have overlapping lines, play with alpha (transparency) and facets
