Use the tidyverse package to wrangle data 

Each function acts on a data frame and returns a data frame: 

- arrange: arrange the rows according to some column
- filter: filter out or obtain a subset of the rows
- select: select a subset of columns 
- mutate: create a new column 
- summarize: create a numerical summary of a column 
- group_by: group the rows by a specific column 

Which verb would help usâ€¦

1. Keep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc): **select** 

2. Get only the data on Minnesota: **filter** 

3. Define a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16: **mutate** 

4. Sort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support: **arrange** 

5. Determine the total number of votes cast across all counties: **summarize* 

Structure of a few function: 

1. Select: select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))

2. Filter: filter(elections, state_name == "Minnesota")

Select always goes before filter!
