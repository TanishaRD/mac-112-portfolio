Types of ineffective visualizations: 

1. ugly: the aesthetics are not nice, but the data is all technically correct 

2. bad: the graph is overly confusing or complex

3. wrong: the visualization is objectively correct, but the numbers/trends are not represented correctly 

Parts of an effective visualization: 

1. professionalism: labelled axes, captions, and a tile 

2. acessibility: alt text, color-blind accessible pallette

3. ethics: make sure your data is collected and displayed ethically (is not purposefully misleading)
