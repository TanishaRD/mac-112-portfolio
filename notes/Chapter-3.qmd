Data visualization lets you find outliers, look at the shape of the data, and identify trends. Keep in mind when creating a graphic:

-   Axes variables and names
-   Colors & Themes: make is accessibility friendly
-   Facets
-   Scale + floating axes
-   Layers: how many lines, points, bars

To do this in R, we use the package ggplot2.
