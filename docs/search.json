    "text": "Exercise 7: A histogram of elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable, it’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome (as the bar graph did above). It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? About 6 hikes\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? About 2 hikes\n\n\n\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize here what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nMost hikes in this data set have an elevation from 4000ft to 4800ft. This data is right-skewed (uni modal). There don’t seem to be any extreme outliers. The data is not very spread out, and seems centered around 4400ft.",

(Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=sat))+\n  geom_histogram(bindwidth=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nThe average SAT score ranges from 800 to 1150. The data seems to be unimodal, with the mode at about 890. The data is positively skewed.\n\n\n\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\n\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\nggplot(education, aes(x=expend, y=sat))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method='lm')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\nggplot(education, aes(x=salary, y=sat))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method='lm')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\nIt is surprising: as expenditure per pupil increase, the average sat score seems to reduce.\n\n\n\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=expend, y=sat, color=salary))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nIt cuts into 3 parts if you change 2 to 3: the general syntax for cut is cut(var_to_cut, number_of_cuts)\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\nWith an increase in teacher salary, the expenditure per student also increases. As these two explanatory variables increase, the SAT score decreases: first steeply, and then more gradually.\n\n\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\n\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=fracCat))+\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of states that fall into the category of 15% or less students take the SAT is about 21. The number of states that fall into the category of 15% to 45% of students take the SAT is about 7. The number of states that fall into the category of 45% to 100% of students take the SAT is about 22.\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=fracCat, y=sat))+\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the fraction of students that take the sat is lesser, the median average SAT score is higher.\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\n\nPart a\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nThe more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be. This is probably related to self-selection.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nWhen we control for the fraction of students that take the SAT, SAT scores increase with expenditure.\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, fracCat seems to be a confounding variable that conforms to Simpson’s paradox (switch the relationship between expend and sat).\n\n\nPart d\nStudent participation tends to be lower among states with lower expenditures (which are likely also the states with higher ed institutions that haven’t historically required the SAT). Those same states tend to have higher SAT scores because of the self-selection of who participates.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Preview\nYou’ll explore some R spatial viz tools below. In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\n\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\n\n\n4.1.2 Part 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\n\n\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       46      -123\n2       33        52\n3       48       -90\n4       36      -112\n5       59        25\n6       39      -106\n\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nYou can see the type of landscape, the roads. You lose information from other places when you do this.\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") %&gt;%\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) %&gt;%\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks %&gt;%   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\n\nleaflet(data=starbucks_mn)%&gt;%\n  addTiles()%&gt;%\n  addMarkers(lat=~Latitude, lng=~Longitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Part 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\n\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.2, size=0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\n\n\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\n\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# What does this code produce?\n# What geom are we using for the point map?\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# How does this change how we use geom_point?!\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nSummarize what you learned about Starbucks from this map.\nThe more colonial the country, the more starbucks (except for Italy).\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united states of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\n\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\n# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks %&gt;% \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\ncma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n  country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\n# Just the boundaries\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add the points\n# And zoom in\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\n\n\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nstarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks %&gt;% \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states. This requires st_as_sf() in the sf package, and map() in the maps package, where the countries are labeled ‘minnesota’, ‘north dakota’, etc.\n\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# Get the boundaries\nmidwest_boundaries &lt;- st_as_sf(\n  maps::map(\"county\",\n            region = c(\"minnesota\", \"wisconsin\", \"north dakota\", \"south dakota\"), \n            fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(midwest_boundaries)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.81268 ymin: 45.05167 xmax: -93.01397 ymax: 48.53526\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs +type=crs\n                                     ID                           geom\nminnesota,aitkin       minnesota,aitkin MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.03689 4...\nminnesota,anoka         minnesota,anoka MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.51817 4...\nminnesota,becker       minnesota,becker MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.14537 4...\nminnesota,beltrami   minnesota,beltrami MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.58655 4...\nminnesota,benton       minnesota,benton MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.77027 4...\nminnesota,big stone minnesota,big stone MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.10794 4...\n\n\n\nPart b\nAdjust the code below to make the plot!

Consider the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US that we mapped earlier:\n\n# Point map (we made this earlier)\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow check out the contour map.\n\n# What changed in the plot?\n# What changed in our code?!\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_density_2d(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Part 3: Choropleth maps\nSpatial data isn’t always in the form of point locations! For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state %&gt;% \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties %&gt;% \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\n\n\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.) Instead, we can use the map_data() function from the ggplot2 package:\n\n\n# Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of state boundaries\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(states_map)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\n\nPause\nImportant detail: Note that the region variable in states_map, and the state_name variable in elections_by_state both label states by the full name in lower case letters.
