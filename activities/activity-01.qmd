 I did not understand how to push changes. Every time I push changes and pressed 'View On Github', I got an error 404 not found. I don't know why. 
 
 However, with the actual homework, I understood everything. 
 
 I learned that there are two modes: source and visual, and I figured out how to switch between the two, and how code shows up differently on both modes.
